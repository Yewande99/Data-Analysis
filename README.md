# Employee Attrition Rate Analysis â€“ Company ABC
### Executive Overview

Company ABC, a mid-sized organization (fictional for this project), has been facing challenges with employee attrition, absenteeism, and workforce distribution. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment costs, lower productivity, and reduced employee morale.

This project aimed to analyze employee data using Excel pivot tables, charts, and dashboards to uncover insights into attrition drivers, salary trends, performance distribution, and workforce demographics. The ultimate goal was to help HR and management make informed, data-driven decisions.

### Methodology & Tools
The analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel using:
* Pivot Tables (to aggregate, summarize, and slice data).
* Charts (bar, pie, line, clustered column, 3D visuals, and maps).
* A Final Dashboard (to present KPIs in a single view).

**Workflow:**
1. Data cleaning and structuring.
2. Building pivot tables for different HR metrics.
3. Visualizing trends through charts.
4. Combining insights into a dashboard.
